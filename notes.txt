Things to explain

- 2-d CFT and its factorization property
-- the example of the free boson

- Virasoro blocks
-- definition
-- their expected role in 3d Teichmuller TQFT
-- their relation to AGT
-- their relation to tau functions (via c=1)
-- their relation to random matrices
-- abelianization
-- semiclassical blocks and their relation again to tau functions
-- extension to W-algebras

- Kac-Moody blocks
-- their use for Chern-Simons theory / knot invariants (integer level)
-- their use in geometric Langlands (critical level)
-- their use for constructing/studying representations of quantum groups
-- relation between KM blocks and nonabelian theta functions
hopefully it's in Beauville–Laszlo, "Conformal blocks and generalized theta functions"
or in Shrawan Kumar book from 2022; hard direction is to go from theta function to
KM block; the idea: pull back to affine Grassmannian (quotient by G_{out} would give back
Bun_G), get a section of some standard line bundle there; by "Borel-Weil for LG"
this section is an element of the dual of the vacuum representation; saying it comes by pullback
means it's invariant under G_{out} which means it gives an actual conformal block

- rational CFT
-- Verlinde formula?

- minimal models
-- their use in statistical mechanics?

- the relation between Virasoro and KM blocks?
